# Crowdfunding_ETL

In order to complete this project we divided the jupyter notebook starter code into three parts:

1. Creating the Category and Subcategory DataFrames and exporting to .csv files
2. Creating the Campaign DataFrame and exporting to a .csv file
3. Creating the Contacts DataFrame and exporting to a .csv file

We decided that Joanna would complete point 1, Kendal would complete point 2, and Aaron would complete point 3. However, we each ended up working through the entire starter code in jupyter notebook on our own. This is because of a miscommunication on Kendal's part (it was not clear that the three notebooks in the repo -- one per person -- were actually all identical). 

In the end we worked through each of our versions of the jupyter notebook together in class on Monday, June 26, and the finished code in the repo reflects this. 

Below is an explanation of which files in our repo correspond to the different requirements for this project.
